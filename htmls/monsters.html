<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The archmage has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The archmage is an 18th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The archmage can cast <em>disguise self</em> and <em>invisibility</em> at will and has the following wizard spells prepared:</p>
<p>Cantrips (at will): <em>fire bolt</em>, <em>light</em>, <em>mage hand</em>, <em>prestidigitation</em>, <em>shocking grasp</em>

<p><strong>Archmages</strong> are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.</p>
<p>An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage&#39;s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.</p>

<p><strong>Bandits</strong> rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates</strong> are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation&#39;s vessels.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2><p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged attacks with its daggers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scimitar.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dagger.</em></strong> <em>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</p>
<h2>Reactions</h2><p><strong><em>Parry.</em></strong> The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.</p>
<p>It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The <strong>bandit captain</strong> has these qualities in spades.</p>
<p>In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the <strong>pirate captain</strong> is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.</p>
<p>More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain&#39;s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain&#39;s colorful reputation.</p>

<p><strong>Petrifying Gaze.</strong> If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn&#39;t incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the <em>greater restoration</em> spell or other magic.</p>
<p>A creature that isn&#39;t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can&#39;t see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p>
<p>If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.</p>

<p><strong><em>Constrict.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d10+6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10+6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn&#39;t already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swallow.</em></strong> The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir&#39;s turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.</p>
<p>If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the dragon&#39;s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

<p>In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Charge.</em></strong> If the elk moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>

<p>The majestic <strong>giant elk</strong> is rare to the point that its appearance is often taken as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth of a king. Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant elk when visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.</p>

<p><strong><em>Horrifying Visage.</em></strong> Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target&#39;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a <em>greater restoration</em> spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.</p>
<p><strong><em>Possession (Recharge 6).</em></strong> One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn&#39;t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can&#39;t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target&#39;s statistics, but doesn&#39;t gain access to the target&#39;s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</p>
<p>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the <em>dispel evil and good</em> spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The hag can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The hag&#39;s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material Components</p>
<p>At will: <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>minor illusion</em>, <em>vicious mockery</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mimicry.</em></strong> The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2><p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Illusory Appearance.</em></strong> The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</p>
<p><strong><em>Invisible Passage.</em></strong> The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.</p>

<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (2d4+1) slashing damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Luring Song.</em></strong> The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.</p>
<p>While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn&#39;t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p>
<p>A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy&#39;s song for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 23 (50,000 XP)</p>
<p><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The kraken can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Freedom of Movement.</em></strong> The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can&#39;t reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.</p>
<p><strong><em>Siege Monster.</em></strong> The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2><p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 23 (3d8+10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken&#39;s turns.</p>
<p>If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tentacle.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (3d6+10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fling.</em></strong> One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Storm.</em></strong> The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&#39;s turn. The kraken regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Tentacle Attack or Fling.</strong> The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The kraken uses Lightning Storm.</p>
<p><strong>Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken&#39;s next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Petrifying Gaze.</em></strong> When a creature that can see the medusa&#39;s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn&#39;t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the <em>greater restoration</em> spell or other magic.</p>
<p>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can&#39;t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p>
<p>If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2><p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The medusa makes either three melee attacks-one with its snake hair and two with its shortsword-or two ranged attacks with its longbow.</p>

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reflective Carapace.</em></strong> Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a <em>magic missile</em> spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Siege Monster.</em></strong> The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2><p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 36 (4d12+10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can&#39;t bite another target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d8+10) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horns.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 32 (4d10+10) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 24 (4d6+10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the tarrasque&#39;s choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature&#39;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque&#39;s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swallow.</em></strong> The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite&#39;s damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque&#39;s turns.</p>
<p>If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shapechanger.</em></strong> If the vampire isn&#39;t in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</p>
<p>While in bat form, the vampire can&#39;t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
<p>While in mist form, the vampire can&#39;t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&#39;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&#39;t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Escape.</em></strong> When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn&#39;t in sunlight or running water. If it can&#39;t transform, it is destroyed.</p>
<p>While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can&#39;t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn&#39;t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn&#39;t function at the start of the vampire&#39;s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vampire Weaknesses.</em></strong> The vampire has the following flaws:</p>
<p><em>Forbiddance</em>. The vampire can&#39;t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</p>
<p><em>Harmed by Running Water</em>. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.</p>
<p><em>Stake to the Heart</em>. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire&#39;s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</p>
<p><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity</em>. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2><p><strong><em>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).</em></strong> The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target&#39;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire&#39;s control.</p>
<p><strong><em>Charm.</em></strong> The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn&#39;t under the vampire&#39;s control, it takes the vampire&#39;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&#39;s bite attack.</p>
<p>Each time the vampire or the vampire&#39;s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Children of the Night (1/Day).</em></strong> The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn&#39;t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.</p>
<h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&#39;s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Move.</strong> The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed Strike.</strong> The vampire makes one unarmed strike.</p>
<p><strong>Bite (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The vampire makes one bite attack.</p>

<p>A <strong>worg</strong> is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well</p>
