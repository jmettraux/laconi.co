<article id="article-conditions"><h1 id="CONDITIONS">CONDITIONS</h1>
<section>
<p>Conditions alter a creature&#39;s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster&#39;s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p>
<p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
<p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition&#39;s effects don&#39;t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.</p>
<h2>Blinded</h2>
<ul>
<li>A blinded creature can&#39;t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Charmed</h2>
<ul>
<li>A charmed creature can&#39;t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>
<li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deafened</h2>
<ul>
<li>A deafened creature can&#39;t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exhaustion</h2><p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect&#39;s description.</p>
<p><strong>Table- Exhaustion Effects</strong></p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Disadvantage on ability checks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Speed halved</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Hit point maximum halved</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Speed reduced to 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Death</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect&#39;s description.</p>
<p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p>
<p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect&#39;s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature&#39;s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p>
<p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature&#39;s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature&#39;s exhaustion level by 1.</p>
<h2>Frightened</h2>
<ul>
<li>A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</li>
<li>The creature can&#39;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grappled</h2>
<ul>
<li>A grappled creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
<li>The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).</li>
<li>The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the <em>thunder-wave</em> spell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Incapacitated</h2>
<ul>
<li>An incapacitated creature can&#39;t take actions or reactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Invisible</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature&#39;s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</p></li>

</ul>

<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
<li>The creature has resistance to all damage.</li>
<li>The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Poisoned</h2>
<ul>
<li>A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prone</h2>
<ul>
<li>A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</li>
<li>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.</li>
<li>An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restrained</h2>
<ul>
<li>A restrained creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
