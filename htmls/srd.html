<article><h1 id="RACES">RACES</h1>
<section><h2>Racial Traits</h2><p>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.</p>
<h3>Ability Score Increase</h3><p>Every race increases one or more of a character&#39;s ability scores.</p>
<h3>Age</h3><p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race&#39;s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p>
<h3>Alignment</h3><p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.</p>
<h3>Size</h3><p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3><p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling and fighting.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3><p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.</p>
<h3>Subraces</h3><p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Human">Human</h1><h3>Human Traits</h3><p>It&#39;s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase</em></strong>. Your ability scores each increase by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age</em></strong>. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alignment</em></strong>. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size</em></strong>. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed</em></strong>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Languages</em></strong>. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.</p>

<h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can&#39;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
<h3>Archery</h3><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
<h3>Defense</h3><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
<h3>Dueling</h3><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
<h3>Great Weapon Fighting</h3><p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
<h3>Protection</h3><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
<h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
<h3>Second Wind</h3><p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<h3>Action Surge</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>
<h3>Martial Archetype</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>
<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&#39;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<p>The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.</p>
<h3>Indomitable</h3><p>Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can&#39;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.</p>
<h2>Martial Archetypes</h2><p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.</p>
<h3>Champion</h3><p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.</p>
<h3>Improved Critical</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
<h3>Remarkable Athlete</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn&#39;t already use your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.</p>
<h3>Additional Fighting Style</h3><p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.</p>
<h3>Superior Critical</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.</p>
<h3>Survivor</h3><p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don&#39;t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p>

<h3>Expertise</h3><p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves&#39; tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>
<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves&#39; tools) to gain this benefit.</p>
<h3>Sneak Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe&#39;s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn&#39;t incapacitated, and you don&#39;t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>
<h3>Thieves&#39; Cant</h3><p>During your rogue training you learned thieves&#39; cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves&#39; cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>
<p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves&#39; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>
<h3>Cunning Action</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>
<h3>Roguish Archetype</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>
<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&#39;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack&#39;s damage against you.</p>
<h3>Evasion</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon&#39;s fiery breath or an <em>ice storm</em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
<h3>Reliable Talent</h3><p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>
<h3>Blindsense</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>
<h3>Slippery Mind</h3><p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>
<h3>Elusive</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren&#39;t incapacitated.</p>
<h3>Stroke of Luck</h3><p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h2>Roguish Archetypes</h2><p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>
<h3>Thief</h3><p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn&#39;t employ.</p>
<h3>Fast Hands</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves&#39; tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</p>
<h3>Second-Story Work</h3><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p>
<p>In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<h3>Supreme Sneak</h3><p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>
<h3>Use Magic Device</h3><p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>
<h3>Thief&#39;s Reflexes</h3><p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can&#39;t use this feature when you are surprised.</p>

<h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>
<h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>
<h3>Spellbook</h3><p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>
<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3><p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p>For example, if you&#39;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>magic missile</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#39;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&#39;t need to have the spell prepared.</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
<h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</p>
<h3>Arcane Recovery</h3><p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
<p>For example, if you&#39;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>
<h3>Arcane Tradition</h3><p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p>
<p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&#39;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3>Spell Mastery</h3><p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
<p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>
<h3>Signature Spells</h3><p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don&#39;t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
<h2>Arcane Traditions</h2><p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>
<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>
<h3>School of Evocation</h3><p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>
<h3>Evocation Savant</h3><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3>Sculpt Spells</h3><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell&#39;s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>
<h3>Potent Cantrip</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip&#39;s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
<h3>Empowered Evocation</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>
<h3>Overchannel</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p>
<p>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your Spellbook</strong></p>
<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&#39;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>
<p><strong><em>Copying a Spell into the Book</em></strong>. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>
<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>
<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Replacing the Book</em></strong>. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>
<p>*If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Book&#39;s Appearance</em></strong>. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap</p>

<article><h1 id="ABILITIES">ABILITIES</h1>
<section>
<p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature&#39;s physical and mental characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strength</strong>, measuring physical power</li>
<li><strong>Dexterity</strong>, measuring agility</li>
<li><strong>Constitution</strong>, measuring endurance</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence</strong>, measuring reasoning and memory</li>
<li><strong>Wisdom</strong>, measuring perception and insight</li>
<li><strong>Charisma</strong>, measuring force of personality</li>
</ul>
<p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature&#39;s assets as well as weaknesses.</p>
<p>The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book&#39;s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.</p>
<h2>Ability Scores and Modifiers</h2><p>Each of a creature&#39;s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature&#39;s training and competence in activities related to that ability.</p>
<p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p>
<p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p>
<p><strong>Table- Ability Scores and Modifiers</strong></p>

<p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).</p>
<p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Advantage_and_Disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h1><p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
<p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don&#39;t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p>
<p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>
<p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling&#39;s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p>
<p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The</p>
<p>GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Proficiency_Bonus">Proficiency Bonus</h1><p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p>
<p>Your proficiency bonus can&#39;t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p>
<p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue&#39;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p>
<p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn&#39;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don&#39;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p>
<p>In general, you don&#39;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Ability_Checks">Ability Checks</h1><p>An ability check tests a character&#39;s or monster&#39;s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p>
<p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.</p>
<p>The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>
<p><strong>Table- Difficulty Classes</strong></p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Task Difficulty</th>
<th>DC</th>

</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Very easy</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Easy</td>
<td>10</td>

<tr>

</tbody></table>
<p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it&#39;s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.</p>
<h2>Contests</h2><p>Sometimes one character&#39;s or monster&#39;s efforts are directly opposed to another&#39;s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal- for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>
<p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>
<p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2><p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual&#39;s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character&#39;s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster&#39;s skill proficiencies appear in the monster&#39;s stat block.)</p>
<p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character&#39;s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>
<p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability&#39;s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, &quot;Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.&quot; At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p>
<p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character&#39;s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p>
<h3>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h3><p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you&#39;re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p>
<h2>Passive Checks</h2><p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn&#39;t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how to determine a character&#39;s total for a passive check:</p>
<p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>
<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <strong>score</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.</p>
<p>The rules on hiding in the &quot;Dexterity&quot; section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.</p>
<h2>Working Together</h2><p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who&#39;s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.</p>
<p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves&#39; tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can&#39;t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p>
<h3>Group Checks</h3><p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren&#39;t.</p>
<p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p>
<p>Group checks don&#39;t come up very often, and they&#39;re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>
<h2>Using Each Ability</h2><p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.</p>
<h3>Strength</h3><p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</p>
<h3>Strength Checks</h3><p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Athletics</em></strong>. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li>
<li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li>
<li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Other Strength Checks</em></strong>. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>
<li>Break free of bonds</li>
<li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>
<li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>
<li>Tip over a statue</li>
<li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attack Rolls and Damage</h3><p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>
<h3>Lifting and Carrying</h3><p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>
<p><strong><em>Carrying Capacity</em></strong>. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don&#39;t usually have to worry about it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Push, Drag, or Lift</em></strong>. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size and Strength</em></strong>. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature&#39;s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p>
<h3>Variant: Encumbrance</h3><p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.</p>
<p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p>
<p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead <strong>heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p>
<h3>Dexterity</h3><p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p>
<h3>Dexterity Checks</h3><p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acrobatics</em></strong>. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you&#39;re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship&#39;s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sleight of Hand</em></strong>. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person&#39;s pocket.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stealth</em></strong>. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Dexterity Checks</em></strong>. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>

<h3>Attack Rolls and Damage</h3><p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p>
<h3>Armor Class</h3><p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.</p>
<h3>Initiative</h3><p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures&#39; turns in combat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hiding</strong></p>
<p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check&#39;s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.</p>
<p>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p>
<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>
<p><strong><em>Passive Perception</em></strong>. When you hide, there&#39;s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren&#39;t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature&#39;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature&#39;s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>
<p><strong><em>What Can You See?</em></strong> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured</strong>, as explained in the &quot;Adventuring&quot; section.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Constitution</h3><p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>
<h3>Constitution Checks</h3><p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p>
<p>The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hold your breath</li>
<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>
<li>Go without sleep</li>
<li>Survive without food or water</li>
<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hit Points</h3><p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p>
<p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you&#39;re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>
<h3>Intelligence</h3><p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p>
<h3>Intelligence Checks</h3><p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arcana</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.</p>
<p><strong><em>History</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Investigation</em></strong>. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nature</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p>
<p><strong><em>Religion</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Intelligence Checks</em></strong>. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>
<li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>
<li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>
<li>Forge a document</li>
<li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>
<li>Win a game of skill</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>
<h3>Wisdom</h3><p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p>
<h3>Wisdom Checks</h3><p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone&#39;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Animal Handling</em></strong>. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal&#39;s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insight</em></strong>. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone&#39;s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p>
<p><strong><em>Medicine</em></strong>. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Perception</em></strong>. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p>
<p><strong><em>Survival</em></strong>. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Wisdom Checks</em></strong>. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
<li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>
<h3>Charisma</h3><p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>
<h3>Charisma Checks</h3><p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deception</em></strong>. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone&#39;s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intimidation</em></strong>. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Performance</em></strong>. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Persuasion</em></strong>. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Charisma Checks</em></strong>. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>
<li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Saving_Throws">Saving Throws</h1><p>A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don&#39;t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>
<p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p>
<p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.</p>
<p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>
<p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster&#39;s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>

<article><h1 id="COMBAT">COMBAT</h1>
<section>
<p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A <strong>round</strong> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <strong>turn</strong>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>

<blockquote>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Combat_Step_by_Step">Combat Step by Step</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>
<li><strong>Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers&#39; marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.</li>
<li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants&#39; turns.</li>
<li><strong>Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li>
<li><strong>Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2>Surprise</h2><p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p>
<p>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn&#39;t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re surprised, you can&#39;t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can&#39;t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren&#39;t.</p>
<h2>Initiative</h2><p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p>
<p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p>
<p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>
<h2>Your Turn</h2><p>On your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> a distance up to your speed and <strong>take one action</strong>. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed- sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet.</p>
<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the &quot;Actions in Combat&quot; section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>
<p>The &quot;Movement and Position&quot; section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.</p>
<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can&#39;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in &quot;Actions in Combat.&quot;</p>
<h2>Bonus Actions</h2><p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don&#39;t have a bonus action to take.</p>
<p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p>
<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action&#39;s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p>
<h2>Other Activity on Your Turn</h2><p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p>
<p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>
<p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
<p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Reactions">Reactions</h1><p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else&#39;s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p>
<p>When you take a reaction, you can&#39;t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature&#39;s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Movement_and_Position">Movement and Position</h1><p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p>
<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you&#39;re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p>
<h2>Breaking Up Your Move</h2><p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>
<h3>Moving between Attacks</h3><p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>
<h3>Using Different Speeds</h3><p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you&#39;ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can&#39;t use the new speed during the current move.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the <em>fly</em> spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p>
<h2>Difficult Terrain</h2><p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>
<h2>Being Prone</h2><p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.</p>
<p>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your speed. <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend</p>
<p>15 feet of movement to stand up. You can&#39;t stand up if you don&#39;t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<p>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interacting with Objects Around You</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p>

<ul>
<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>
<li>open or close a door</li>
<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>
<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>
<li>take a bauble from a table</li>
<li>remove a ring from your finger</li>
<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>
<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>
<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>
<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>
<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>
<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>
<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>
<li>extinguish a small flame</li>
<li>don a mask</li>
<li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>
<li>put your ear to a door</li>
<li>kick a small stone</li>
<li>turn a key in a lock</li>
<li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li>
<li>hand an item to another character</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Moving Around Other Creatures</h2><p>You can move through a nonhostile creature&#39;s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature&#39;s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature&#39;s space is difficult terrain for you.</p>
<p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can&#39;t willingly end your move in its space.</p>
<p>If you leave a hostile creature&#39;s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p>
<h2>Flying Movement</h2><p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the <em>fly</em> spell.</p>
<h2>Creature Size</h2><p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>
<p><strong>Table- Creature Size</strong></p>

<table><thead>
<tr>

</tbody></table>
<h3>Space</h3><p>A creature&#39;s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn&#39;t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway, other creatures can&#39;t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>
<p>A creature&#39;s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there&#39;s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p>
<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there&#39;s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>
<h3>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h3><p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that&#39;s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it&#39;s in the smaller space.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Actions_in_Combat">Actions in Combat</h1><p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p>
<p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>
<h2>Attack</h2><p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p>
<p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the &quot;Making an Attack&quot; section for the rules that govern attacks.</p>
<p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p>
<h2>Cast a Spell</h2><p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.</p>
<h2>Dash</h2><p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.</p>
<p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p>
<h2>Disengage</h2><p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn&#39;t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>
<h2>Dodge</h2><p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.</p>
<h2>Help</h2><p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally&#39;s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p>
<h2>Hide</h2><p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the &quot;Unseen Attackers and Targets&quot; section later in this chapter.</p>
<h2>Ready</h2><p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &quot;If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I&#39;ll pull the lever that opens it,&quot; and &quot;If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.&quot;</p>
<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>
<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell&#39;s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the <em>web</em> spell and ready <em>magic missile</em>, your <em>web</em> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <em>magic missile</em> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>
<h2>Search</h2><p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
<h2>Use an Object</h2><p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p>

<section><h1 id="Making_an_Attack">Making an Attack</h1><p>Whether you&#39;re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a target</strong>. Pick a target within your attack&#39;s <strong>Range:</strong> a creature, an object, or a location.</li>
<li><strong>Determine modifiers</strong>. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>
<li><strong>Resolve the attack</strong>. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there&#39;s ever any question whether something you&#39;re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you&#39;re making an attack roll, you&#39;re making an attack.</p>
<h2>Attack Rolls</h2><p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target&#39;s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.</p>
<h3>Modifiers to the Roll</h3><p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character&#39;s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Modifier.</em></strong> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.</p>
<p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p>
<h3>Rolling 1 or 20</h3><p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target&#39;s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.</p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target&#39;s AC.</p>
<h2>Unseen Attackers and Targets</h2><p>Combatants often try to escape their foes&#39; notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.</p>
<p>When you attack a target that you can&#39;t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you&#39;re guessing the target&#39;s location or you&#39;re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn&#39;t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target&#39;s location correctly.</p>
<p>When a creature can&#39;t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p>
<h2>Ranged Attacks</h2><p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p>
<h3>Range</h3><p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p>
<p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can&#39;t attack a target beyond this range.</p>
<p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can&#39;t attack a target beyond the long range.</p>
<h3>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h3><p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn&#39;t incapacitated.</p>
<h2>Melee Attacks</h2><p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p>
<p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Contests in Combat</em></strong></p>
<p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Opportunity Attacks</h3><p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.</p>
<p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.</p>
<p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don&#39;t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don&#39;t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe&#39;s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p>
<h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3><p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you&#39;re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you&#39;re holding in the other hand. You don&#39;t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>
<p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>
<h3>Grappling</h3><p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you&#39;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>
<p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&#39;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix ##). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p>
<p><strong><em>Escaping a Grapple</em></strong>. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moving a Grappled Creature</em></strong>. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p>
<h3>Shoving a Creature</h3><p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you&#39;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>
<p>The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&#39;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.</p>
<h2>Cover</h2><p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</p>
<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren&#39;t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>half cover</strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>three-quarters cover</strong> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>total cover</strong> can&#39;t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>
<h2>Damage and Healing</h2><p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a <em>fireball</em> spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.</p>
<h3>Hit Points</h3><p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p>
<p>A creature&#39;s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature&#39;s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p>
<p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature&#39;s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<h3>Damage Rolls</h3><p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p>
<p>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A <strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p>
<p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <strong>more than one target</strong> at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts <em>fireball</em> or a cleric casts <em>flame strike</em>, the spell&#39;s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p>
<h3>Critical Hits</h3><p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack&#39;s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack&#39;s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p>
<p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue&#39;s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p>
<h3>Damage Types</h3><p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p>
<p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid</em></strong>. The corrosive spray of a black dragon&#39;s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bludgeoning</em></strong>. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cold</em></strong>. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil&#39;s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon&#39;s breath deal cold damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fire</em></strong>. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Force</em></strong>. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including <em>magic missile</em> and <em>spiritual weapon</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning</em></strong>. A <em>lightning bolt</em> spell and a blue dragon&#39;s breath deal lightning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Necrotic</em></strong>. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as <em>chill touch</em>, withers matter and even the soul.</p>
<p><strong><em>Piercing</em></strong>. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters&#39; bites, deal piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poison</em></strong>. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon&#39;s breath deal poison damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychic</em></strong>. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer&#39;s psionic blast deal psychic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Radiant</em></strong>. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric&#39;s <em>flame strike</em> spell or an angel&#39;s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slashing</em></strong>. Swords, axes, and monsters&#39; claws deal slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thunder</em></strong>. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the <em>thunderwave</em> spell, deals thunder damage.</p>
<h3>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h3><p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p>
<p>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p>
<p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p>
<p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>
<h3>Healing</h3><p>Unless it results in death, damage isn&#39;t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature&#39;s hit points, and magical methods such as a <em>cure wounds</em> spell or a <em>potion of healing</em> can remove damage in an instant.</p>
<p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature&#39;s hit points can&#39;t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p>
<p>A creature that has died can&#39;t regain hit points until magic such as the <em>revivify</em> spell has restored it to life.</p>
<h3>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3><p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Instant Death</h3><p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p>
<p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p>
<h3>Falling Unconscious</h3><p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix ##). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.</p>
<h3>Death Saving Throws</h3><p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn&#39;t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p>
<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don&#39;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rolling 1 or 20</em></strong>. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damage at 0 Hit Points</em></strong>. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing a Creature</h3><p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn&#39;t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p>
<p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>
<p>A <strong>stable</strong> creature doesn&#39;t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn&#39;t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>
<h3>Monsters and Death</h3><p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.</p>
<p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.</p>
<h2>Knocking a Creature Out</h2><p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.</p>
<h2>Temporary Hit Points</h2><p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren&#39;t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p>
<p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p>
<p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>
<p>Healing can&#39;t restore temporary hit points, and they can&#39;t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>
<p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn&#39;t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you&#39;re in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p>
<p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they&#39;re depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>

<section><h1 id="Mounted_Combat">Mounted Combat</h1><p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p>
<p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p>
<h2>Mounting and Dismounting</h2><p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can&#39;t mount it if you don&#39;t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you&#39;re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you&#39;re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p>
<p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.</p>
<h2>Controlling a Mount</h2><p>While you&#39;re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p>
<p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p>
<p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p>
<p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you&#39;re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Underwater_Combat">Underwater Combat</h1><p>When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.</p>
<p>When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that doesn&#39;t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.</p>
<p>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon&#39;s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).</p>
<p>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Conditions">Conditions</h1><p>Conditions alter a creature&#39;s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster&#39;s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p>
<p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
<p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition&#39;s effects don&#39;t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.</p>
<h2>Blinded</h2>
<ul>
<li>A blinded creature can&#39;t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Charmed</h2>
<ul>
<li>A charmed creature can&#39;t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>
<li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deafened</h2>
<ul>
<li>A deafened creature can&#39;t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exhaustion</h2><p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect&#39;s description.</p>
<p><strong>Table- Exhaustion Effects</strong></p>

<table><thead>

<p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect&#39;s description.</p>
<p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p>
<p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect&#39;s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature&#39;s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p>
<p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature&#39;s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature&#39;s exhaustion level by 1.</p>
<h2>Frightened</h2>
<ul>
<li>A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</li>
<li>The creature can&#39;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grappled</h2>
<ul>
<li>A grappled creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
<li>The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).</li>
<li>The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the <em>thunder-wave</em> spell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Incapacitated</h2>
<ul>
<li>An incapacitated creature can&#39;t take actions or reactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Invisible</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature&#39;s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</p></li>
<li><p>Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have advantage.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Paralyzed</h2>
<ul>
<li>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can&#39;t move or speak.</li>
<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
<li>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Petrified</h2>
<ul>
<li>A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.</li>
<li>The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can&#39;t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
<li>The creature has resistance to all damage.</li>
<li>The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Poisoned</h2>
<ul>
<li>A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prone</h2>
<ul>
<li>A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</li>
<li>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.</li>
<li>An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restrained</h2>
<ul>
<li>A restrained creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
<li>The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stunned</h2>

<section><h1 id="Time">Time</h1><p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers&#39; movement happens on a scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p>
<p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours&#39; time.</p>
<p>For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best.</p>
<p>Following the road from Baldur&#39;s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p>
<p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on <strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Movement">Movement</h1><p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p>
<p>The GM can summarize the adventurers&#39; movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: &quot;You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.&quot; Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: &quot;After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#39;s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they&#39;re moving over.</p>
<h2>Speed</h2><p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
<h3>Travel Pace</h3><p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forced March</em></strong>. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>
<p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix ##).</p>
<p><strong><em>Mounts and Vehicles</em></strong>. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don&#39;t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>
<p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a <em>carpet of flying</em>, allow you to travel more swiftly.</p>

<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3><p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult terrain.</p>
<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain- moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
<h2>Special Types of Movement</h2><p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>
<h3>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h3><p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM&#39;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<h3>Jumping</h3><p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p>
<p><strong><em>Long Jump</em></strong>. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>
<p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn&#39;t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM&#39;s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump&#39;s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>
<p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>High Jump</em></strong>. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p>
<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="The_Environment">The Environment</h1><p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.</p>
<h2>Falling</h2><p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p>
<h2>Suffocating</h2><p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p>
<p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can&#39;t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p>
<p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<h2>Vision and Light</h2><p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring- noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character&#39;s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p>
<p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a <strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
<p>A <strong>heavily obscured</strong> area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix ##) when trying to see something in that area.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p>
<p><strong>Bright light</strong> lets most creatures see normally.</p>
<p>Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p>
<p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>
<p><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area.</p>
<p>Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p>
<h3>Blindsight</h3><p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.</p>
<h3>Darkvision</h3><p>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can&#39;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<h3>Truesight</h3><p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<h2>Food and Water</h2><p>Characters who don&#39;t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix ##). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can&#39;t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p>
<h3>Food</h3><p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p>
<p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p>
<h3>Water</h3><p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>
<p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p>
<h2>Interacting with Objects</h2><p>A character&#39;s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.</p>
<p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p>
<p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object&#39;s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It&#39;s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p>
<p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Resting">Resting</h1><p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can&#39;t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.</p>
<p>Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.</p>
<h2>Short Rest</h2><p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.</p>
<p>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character&#39;s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character&#39;s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character&#39;s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.</p>
<h2>Long Rest</h2><p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character&#39;s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p>
<p>A character can&#39;t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Between_Adventures">Between Adventures</h1><p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p>
<p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p>
<h2>Lifestyle Expenses</h2><p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn&#39;t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p>
<h2>Downtime Activities</h2><p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>
<p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p>
<h3>Crafting</h3><p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan&#39;s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith&#39;s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p>
<p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5 gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p>
<p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p>
<p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.</p>
<h3>Practicing a Profession</h3><p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.</p>
<p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves&#39; guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p>
<p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p>
<h3>Recuperating</h3><p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p>
<p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:</p>

<ul>
<li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li>
<li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Researching</h3><p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.</p>
<p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone&#39;s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.</p>
<p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.</p>
<h3>Training</h3><p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.</p>
<p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.</p>
<p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p>

<section><h2>Coinage</h2><p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p>
<p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The old piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p>
<p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.</p>
<p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p>
<p>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p>

<h2>Selling Treasure</h2><p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment</em></strong>. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Items</em></strong>. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn&#39;t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won&#39;t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects</em></strong>. These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trade Goods</em></strong>. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.</p>
<h2>Coinage</h2><p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p>

<section><h1 id="Armor">Armor</h1><p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p>
<p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armor Proficiency</em></strong>. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor&#39;s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can&#39;t cast spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armor Class (AC)</em></strong>. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heavy Armor</em></strong>. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer&#39;s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows &quot;Str 13&quot; or &quot;Str 15&quot; in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer&#39;s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stealth</em></strong>. If the Armor table shows &quot;Disadvantage&quot; in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shields</em></strong>. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p>
<h2>Light Armor</h2><p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p>
<p><strong><em>Padded</em></strong>. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leather</em></strong>. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Studded Leather</em></strong>. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p>
<h2>Medium Armor</h2><p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hide</em></strong>. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chain Shirt</em></strong>. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer&#39;s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scale Mail</em></strong>. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breastplate</em></strong>. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer&#39;s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p>
<p><strong><em>Half Plate</em></strong>. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer&#39;s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p>
<h2>Heavy Armor</h2><p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p>
<p>Heavy armor doesn&#39;t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn&#39;t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ring Mail</em></strong>. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it&#39;s usually worn only by those who can&#39;t afford better armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chain Mail</em></strong>. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Splint</em></strong>. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Plate</em></strong>. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p>

<h2>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h2><p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor&#39;s category.</p>
<p><strong><em>Don</em></strong>. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor&#39;s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Doff</em></strong>. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.</p>

<section><h1 id="Weapons">Weapons</h1><p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class&#39;s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.</p>
<p>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A <strong>melee weapon</strong> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a <strong>ranged weapon</strong> is used to attack a target at a distance.</p>
<h2>Weapon Proficiency</h2><p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p>
<p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p>
<h2>Weapon Properties</h2><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ammunition</em></strong>. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p>
<p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see &quot;Improvised Weapons&quot; later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Finesse</em></strong>. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heavy</em></strong>. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon&#39;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p>
<p><strong><em>Light</em></strong>. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Loading</em></strong>. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>
<p><strong><em>Range</em></strong>. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&#39;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#39;s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&#39;t attack a target beyond the weapon&#39;s long range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reach</em></strong>. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Special</em></strong>. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon&#39;s description (see &quot;Special Weapons&quot; later in this section).</p>
<p><strong><em>Thrown</em></strong>. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>
<p><strong><em>Two-Handed</em></strong>. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Versatile</em></strong>. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>
<h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p>Sometimes characters don&#39;t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p>
<p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM&#39;s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>
<h3>Silvered Weapons</h3><p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p>
<h3>Special Weapons</h3><p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lance</em></strong>. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren&#39;t mounted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Net</em></strong>. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p>
<p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>

<section><h1 id="Adventuring_Gear">Adventuring Gear</h1><p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid</em></strong>. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alchemist&#39;s Fire</em></strong>. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist&#39;s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p>
<p><strong><em>Antitoxin</em></strong>. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arcane Focus</em></strong>. An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item- designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ball Bearings</em></strong>. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn&#39;t need to make the save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Block and Tackle</em></strong>. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p>
<p><strong><em>Book</em></strong>. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p>
<p><strong><em>Caltrops</em></strong>. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature&#39;s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn&#39;t need to make the save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Candle</em></strong>. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case, Crossbow Bolt</em></strong>. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case, Map or Scroll</em></strong>. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chain</em></strong>. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Climber&#39;s Kit</em></strong>. A climber&#39;s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber&#39;s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can&#39;t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can&#39;t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Component Pouch</em></strong>. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell&#39;s description).</p>
<p><strong><em>Crowbar</em></strong>. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar&#39;s leverage can be applied.</p>
<p><strong><em>Druidic Focus</em></strong>. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fishing Tackle</em></strong>. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer&#39;s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Holy Symbol</em></strong>. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B &quot;Fantasy-Historical Pantheons&quot; lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p>
<p><strong><em>Holy Water</em></strong>. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hunting Trap</em></strong>. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lamp</em></strong>. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lock</em></strong>. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves&#39; tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magnifying Glass</em></strong>. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Manacles</em></strong>. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves&#39; tools can pick the manacles&#39; lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mess Kit</em></strong>. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oil</em></strong>. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poison, Basic</em></strong>. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p>
<p><strong><em>Potion of Healing</em></strong>. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pouch</em></strong>. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rations</em></strong>. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rope</em></strong>. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scale, Merchant&#39;s</em></strong>. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellbook</em></strong>. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spyglass</em></strong>. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tent</em></strong>. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tinderbox</em></strong>. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong><em>Torch</em></strong>. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment Packs</strong></p>
<p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burglar&#39;s Pack (16 gp)</em></strong>. Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Diplomat&#39;s Pack (39 gp)</em></strong>. Includes a chest, 2 cases for maps and scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a lamp, 2 flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of perfume, sealing wax, and soap.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dungeoneer&#39;s Pack (12 gp)</em></strong>. Includes a backpack, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Entertainer&#39;s Pack (40 gp)</em></strong>. Includes a backpack, a bedroll, 2 costumes, 5 candles, 5 days of rations, a waterskin, and a disguise kit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Explorer&#39;s Pack (10 gp)</em></strong>. Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Priest&#39;s Pack (19 gp)</em></strong>. Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10 candles, a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a censer, vestments, 2 days of rations, and a waterskin.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scholar&#39;s Pack (40 gp)</em></strong>. Includes a backpack, a book of lore, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a little bag of sand, and a small knife.</p>

<article><h1 id="SPELLCASTING">SPELLCASTING</h1>
<section>
<p>Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.</p>
<p>This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="What_Is_a_Spell_">What Is a Spell?</h1><p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.</p>
<p>Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix ##), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.</p>
<p>Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse&#39;s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p>
<h2>Spell Level</h2><p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell&#39;s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) <em>magic missile</em> at 1st level and the earth-shaking <em>wish</em> at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell&#39;s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p>
<p>Spell level and character level don&#39;t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p>
<h2>Known and Prepared Spells</h2><p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.</p>
<p>In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character&#39;s level.</p>
<h2>Spell Slots</h2><p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class&#39;s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.</p>
<p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell&#39;s level or higher, effectively &quot;filling&quot; a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts <em>magic missile</em>, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.</p>
<p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.</p>
<p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.</p>
<h3>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h3><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts <em>magic missile</em> using one of her 2nd-level slots, that <em>magic missile</em> is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p>
<p>Some spells, such as <em>magic missile</em> and <em>cure wounds</em>, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell&#39;s description.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Casting in Armor</strong></p>
<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p>
</blockquote>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Cantrips">Cantrips</h1><p>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster&#39;s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip&#39;s spell level is 0.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Rituals">Rituals</h1><p>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn&#39;t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can&#39;t be cast at a higher level.</p>
<p>To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character&#39;s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard&#39;s does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The Schools of Magic</em></strong></p>
<p>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.</p>
<p>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.</p>
<p><strong>Abjuration</strong> spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.</p>
<p><strong>Conjuration</strong> spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster&#39;s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Divination</strong> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.</p>
<p><strong>Enchantment</strong> spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.</p>
<p><strong>Evocation</strong> spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Illusion</strong> spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</p>
<p><strong>Necromancy</strong> spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.</p>
<p>Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Transmutation</strong> spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster&#39;s command, or enhance a creature&#39;s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</p>
</blockquote>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Casting_a_Spell">Casting a Spell</h1><p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character&#39;s class or the spell&#39;s effects.</p>
<p>Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell&#39;s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell&#39;s effect.</p>
<h2>Casting Time</h2><p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p>
<h3>Bonus Action</h3><p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven&#39;t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can&#39;t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3><p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p>
<h3>Longer Casting Times</h3><p>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see &quot;Concentration&quot; below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don&#39;t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</p>
<h2>Spell Range</h2><p>The target of a spell must be within the spell&#39;s range. For a spell like <em>magic missile</em>, the target is a creature. For a spell like <em>fireball</em>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p>
<p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the <em>shield</em> spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p>
<p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell&#39;s effect must be you (see &quot;Areas of Effect&quot; later in the this chapter).</p>
<p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren&#39;t limited by its range, unless the spell&#39;s description says otherwise.</p>
<h2>Components</h2><p>A spell&#39;s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell&#39;s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can&#39;t provide one or more of a spell&#39;s components, you are unable to cast the spell.</p>
<h3>Verbal (V)</h3><p>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren&#39;t the source of the spell&#39;s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the <em>silence</em> spell, can&#39;t cast a spell with a verbal component.</p>
<h3>Somatic (S)</h3><p>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.</p>
<h3>Material (M)</h3><p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a <strong>component pouch</strong> or a <strong>spellcasting focus</strong> (found in &quot;Equipment&quot;) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p>
<p>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.</p>
<p>A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell&#39;s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p>
<h2>Duration</h2><p>A spell&#39;s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p>
<h3>Instantaneous</h3><p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can&#39;t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.</p>
<h3>Concentration</h3><p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p>
<p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>
<p>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn&#39;t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can&#39;t concentrate on two spells at once.</li>
<li><strong>Taking damage.</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon&#39;s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>
<li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed.</strong> You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you&#39;re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</p>
<h2>Targets</h2><p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell&#39;s magic. A spell&#39;s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).</p>
<p>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature&#39;s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.</p>
<h3>A Clear Path to the Target</h3><p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can&#39;t be behind total cover.</p>
<p>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can&#39;t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.</p>
<h3>Targeting Yourself</h3><p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.</p>
<h2>Areas of Effect</h2><p>Spells such as <em>burning hands</em> and <em>cone of cold</em> cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.</p>
<p>A spell&#39;s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a <strong>point of origin</strong>, a location from which the spell&#39;s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p>
<p>A spell&#39;s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn&#39;t included in the spell&#39;s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.</p>
<h3>Cone</h3><p>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone&#39;s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point&#39;s distance from the point of origin. A cone&#39;s area of effect specifies its maximum length.</p>
<p>A cone&#39;s point of origin is not included in the cone&#39;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>
<h3>Cube</h3><p>You select a cube&#39;s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube&#39;s size is expressed as the length of each side.</p>
<p>A cube&#39;s point of origin is not included in the cube&#39;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>
<h3>Cylinder</h3><p>A cylinder&#39;s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell&#39;s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.</p>
<p>A cylinder&#39;s point of origin is included in the cylinder&#39;s area of effect.</p>
<h3>Line</h3><p>A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.</p>
<p>A line&#39;s point of origin is not included in the line&#39;s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>
<h3>Sphere</h3><p>You select a sphere&#39;s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere&#39;s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.</p>
<p>A sphere&#39;s point of origin is included in the sphere&#39;s area of effect.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Spell_Saving_Throws">Spell Saving Throws</h1><p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell&#39;s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p>
<p>The DC to resist one of your spells = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier +  your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Spell_Attack_Rolls">Spell Attack Rolls</h1><p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn&#39;t incapacitated.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Combining_Magical_Effects">Combining Magical Effects</h1><p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don&#39;t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap.</p>
<p>For example, if two clerics cast <em>bless</em> on the same target, that character gains the spell&#39;s benefit only once; he or she doesn&#39;t get to roll two bonus dice.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__A_">Spells (A)</h1><h3>Acid Arrow</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder&#39;s stomach)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Acid Splash</h3><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature you can see within range, or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.</p>
<p>This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
<h3>Aid</h3><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target&#39;s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target&#39;s hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Alarm</h3><p><em>1st-level abjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won&#39;t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.</p>
<p>A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.</p>
<p>An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</p>
<h3>Alter Self</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aquatic Adaptation</em></strong>. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Appearance</em></strong>. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can&#39;t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you&#39;re bipedal, you can&#39;t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Natural Weapons</em></strong>. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p>
<h3>Animal Friendship</h3><p><em>1st-­level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a morsel of food)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast&#39;s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell&#39;s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a  spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast t level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Animal Messenger</h3><p><em>2nd-level enchantment (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a morsel of food)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as &quot;a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard&quot; or &quot;a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.&quot; You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.</p>
<p>When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn&#39;t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Animal Shapes</h3><p><em>8th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 24 hours</p>
<p>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.</p>
<p>The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target&#39;s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce the creature&#39;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#39;t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#39;t speak or cast spells.</p>
<p>The target&#39;s gear melds into the new form. The target can&#39;t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
<h3>Animate Dead</h3><p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature&#39;s game statistics).</p>
<p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
<p>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you&#39;ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.</p>
<h3>Animate Objects</h3><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can&#39;t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

<p>An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is</p>
<p>30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.</p>
<p>If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.</p>
<h3>Antilife Shell</h3><p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (10-foot radius)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.</p>
<p>If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.</p>
<h3>Antimagic Field</h3><p><em>8th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (10-foot radius sphere)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A 10-foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can&#39;t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p>
<p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can&#39;t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn&#39;t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Targeted Effects</em></strong>. Spells and other magical effects, such as <em>magic missile</em> and <em>charm person</em>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Areas of Magic</em></strong>. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <em>fireball</em>, can&#39;t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <em>wall of fire</em> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Items</em></strong>. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a <em>+1 longsword</em> in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>
<p>A magic weapon&#39;s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magical Travel</em></strong>. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the <em>rope trick</em> spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creatures and Objects</em></strong>. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dispel Magic</em></strong>. Spells and magical effects such as <em>dispel magic</em> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different <em>antimagic field</em> spells don&#39;t nullify each other.</p>
<h3>Antipathy/Sympathy</h3><p><em>8th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the <em>antipathy</em> effect or a drop of honey for the <em>sympathy</em> effect)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura&#39;s effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Antipathy</em></strong>. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can&#39;t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can&#39;t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sympathy</em></strong>. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can&#39;t willingly move away from the target.</p>
<p>If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ending the Effect</em></strong>. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</p>
<p>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p>
<h3>Arcane Eye</h3><p><em>4th-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.</p>
<p>You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.</p>
<p>As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can&#39;t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye&#39;s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.</p>
<h3>Arcane Hand</h3><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell&#39;s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.</p>
<p>The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn&#39;t fill its space.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Clenched Fist</em></strong>. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forceful Hand</em></strong>. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.</p>
<p>Make a check with the hand&#39;s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grasping Hand</em></strong>. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand&#39;s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interposing Hand</em></strong>. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can&#39;t move through the hand&#39;s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand&#39;s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand&#39;s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand&#39;s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
<h3>Arcane Lock</h3><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting <em>knock</em> on the object suppresses <em>arcane lock</em> for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.</p>
<h3>Arcane Sword</h3><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.</p>
<h3>Arcanist&#39;s Magic Aura</h3><p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small square of silk)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn&#39;t being carried or worn by another creature.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.</p>
<p><strong><em>False Aura</em></strong>. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as <em>detect magic</em>, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object&#39;s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mask</em></strong>. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin&#39;s Divine Sense or the trigger of a <em>symbol</em> spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.</p>
<h3>Astral Projection</h3><p><em>9th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Special</p>
<p>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn&#39;t need food or air and doesn&#39;t age.</p>
<p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.</p>
<p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</p>
<p>The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p>
<p>The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful <em>dispel magic</em> spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature&#39;s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature&#39;s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p>
<p>If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p>
<h3>Augury</h3><p><em>2nd-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Weal</em>, for good results</li>
<li><em>Woe</em>, for bad results</li>
<li><em>Weal and woe</em>, for both good and bad results</li>
<li><em>Nothing</em>, for results that aren&#39;t especially good or bad</li>
</ul>
<p>The spell doesn&#39;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.</p>
<p>If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.</p>
<h3>Awaken</h3><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human&#39;s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.</p>
<p>The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of blood)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws.

<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Banishment</h3><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.</p>
<p>If the target is native to the plane of existence you&#39;re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>
<p>If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you&#39;re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn&#39;t return.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.</p>
<h3>Barkskin</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target&#39;s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target&#39;s AC can&#39;t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.</p>
<h3>Beacon of Hope</h3><p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em></p>

<h3>Bestow Curse</h3><p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.</li>
<li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li>
<li>While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.</li>
<li>While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>remove curse</em> spell ends this effect. At the GM&#39;s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse&#39;s effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn&#39;t require concentration.</p>
<h3>Black Tentacles</h3><p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet</p>

A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>

You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.</p>
<p>When a creature enters the wall&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<p>If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.</p>
<p>If you target a nonmagical plant that isn&#39;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&#39;t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
<h3>Blindness/Deafness</h3><p><em>2nd-level necromancy</em></p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.</p>
<p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can&#39;t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren&#39;t there can&#39;t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn&#39;t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p>
<h3>Branding Smite</h3><p><em>2nd-­level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it&#39;s invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-­foot radius and can&#39;t become invisible until the spell ends. </p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a  spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd. </p>

<p>The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Spells__C_">Spells (C)</h1><h3>Call Lightning</h3><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can&#39;t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can&#39;t accommodate the cloud).</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.</p>
<p>If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d10.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<h3>Calm Emotions</h3><p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.</p>
<p>You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.</p>

Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.</p>
<p>A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each slot level above 6th.</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p>
<h3>Chill Touch</h3><p><em>Necromancy cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can&#39;t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.</p>
<p>If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
<h3>Circle of Death</h3><p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> 1 mile</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can&#39;t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.</p>
<p>A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from <em>see invisibility</em> or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.</p>
<h3>Clone</h3><p><em>8th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.</p>
<p>At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return.</p>
<p>The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original&#39;s equipment. The original creature&#39;s physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can&#39;t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature&#39;s soul is elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Cloudkill</h3><p><em>5th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a 20-foot radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.</p>
<p>When a creature enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don&#39;t need to breathe.</p>
<p>The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
<h3>Color Spray</h3><p><em>1st-level illusion</em></p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot cone)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can&#39;t see).</p>
<p>Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature&#39;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature&#39;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Command</h3><p><em>1st-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn&#39;t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.</p>
<p>Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can&#39;t follow your command, the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Approach</em></strong>. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Drop</em></strong>. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flee</em></strong>. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grovel</em></strong>. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Halt</em></strong>. The target doesn&#39;t move and takes no actions.</p>
<p>A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p>
<h3>Commune</h3><p><em>5th-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.</p>
<p>Divine beings aren&#39;t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive &quot;unclear&quot; as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity&#39;s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity&#39;s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.</p>
<p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.</p>
<h3>Commune with Nature</h3><p><em>5th-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>

<p>You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn&#39;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.</p>
<p>You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:</p>

<ul>
<li>terrain and bodies of water</li>
<li>prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples</li>
<li>powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead</li>
<li>influence from other planes of existence</li>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.</p>
<p>This spell doesn&#39;t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn&#39;t part of a written language.</p>
<h3>Compulsion</h3><p><em>4th-­level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can&#39;t be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect. </p>
<p>A target isn&#39;t compelled to move into an obviously  deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.</p>
<h3>Cone of Cold</h3><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>

<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

<p>An affected target can&#39;t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>d10</th>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can&#39;t take actions, can&#39;t understand what other creatures say, can&#39;t read, and speak only in gibberish. A <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on you ends this effect.</p>
<p>On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;maybe,&quot; &quot;never,&quot; &quot;irrelevant,&quot; or &quot;unclear&quot; (if the entity doesn&#39;t know the answer to the question).

<h3>Contagion</h3><p><em>5th-level necromancy</em></p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch
<strong>Component:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 days</p>

<p>At the end of each of the poisoned target&#39;s turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell&#39;s duration.</p>
<p>Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease&#39;s effects apply to it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Blinding Sickness</em></strong>. Pain grips the creature&#39;s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.</p>
<p><strong><em>Filth Fever</em></strong>. A raging fever sweeps through the creature&#39;s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mindfire</em></strong>. The creature&#39;s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the <em>confusion</em> spell during combat.</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting <em>contingency</em>, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn&#39;t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a <em>contingency</em> cast with <em>water breathing</em> might stipulate that <em>water breathing</em> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p>
<p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then <em>contingency</em> ends.</p>
<p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <em>contingency</em> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <em>contingency</em> spell on you ends. Also, <em>contingency</em> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>
<h3>Continual Flame</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn&#39;t use oxygen. A <em>continual flame</em> can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.</p>
<h3>Control Water</h3><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flood</em></strong>. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>
<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&#39;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>
<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Part Water</em></strong>. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell&#39;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>
<p><strong><em>Redirect Flow</em></strong>. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&#39;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whirlpool</em></strong>. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.</p>
<p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&#39;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p>
<p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>
<h3>Control Weather</h3><p><em>8th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (5-mile radius)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 8 hours</p>
<p>You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don&#39;t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.</p>
<p>When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.</p>

<h3>Counterspell</h3><p><em>3rd-­level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell&#39;s level. On a success, the creature&#39;s spell fails and has no effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used. </p>
<h3>Create Food and Water</h3><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn&#39;t go bad.</p>
<h3>Create or Destroy Water</h3><p><em>1st-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You either create or destroy water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Create Water</em></strong>. You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Destroy Water</em></strong>. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Create Undead</h3><p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)</p>
<p>As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
<p>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Special</p>
<p>You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within 
<strong>Range:</strong> soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.</p>
<p>The duration depends on the object&#39;s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.</p>

<p>Using any material created by this spell as another spell&#39;s material component causes that spell to fail.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.</p>
<h3>Cure Wounds</h3><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__D_">Spells (D)</h1><h3>Dancing Lights</h3><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>
<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell&#39;s range.</p>
<h3>Darkness</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can&#39;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&#39;t illuminate it.</p>
<p>If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn&#39;t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.</p>
<p>If any of this spell&#39;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
<h3>Darkvision</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
<h3>Daylight</h3><p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>A 60-foot radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.</p>
<p>If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn&#39;t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.</p>
<p>If any of this spell&#39;s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.</p>
<h3>Death Ward</h3><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.</p>
<p>The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.</p>
<p>If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.</p>
<h3>Delayed Blast Fireball</h3><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The spell&#39;s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.</p>
<p>If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.</p>
<p>The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</p>
<h3>Demiplane</h3><p><em>8th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.</p>
<p>Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.</p>
<h3>Detect Evil and Good</h3><p><em>1st-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.</p>
<p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
<h3>Detect Magic</h3><p><em>1st-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.</p>
<p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
<h3>Detect Poison and Disease</h3><p><em>1st-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a yew leaf)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.</p>
<p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
<h3>Detect Thoughts</h3><p><em>2nd-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a copper piece)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn&#39;t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>
<p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature&#39;s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature&#39;s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature&#39;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>
<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>
<p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can&#39;t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can&#39;t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn&#39;t speak any language.</p>
<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can&#39;t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>
<h3>Dimension Door</h3><p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 500 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as &quot;200 feet straight downward&quot; or &quot;upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.&quot;</p>
<p>You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&#39;t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.</p>
<p>If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.</p>
<h3>Disguise Self</h3><p><em>1st-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You make yourself-including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person- look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&#39;t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p>
<p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>
<h3>Disintegrate</h3><p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by <em>wall of force</em>.</p>
<p>A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.</p>
<p>A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a <em>true resurrection</em> or a <em>wish</em> spell.</p>
<p>This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
<h3>Dispel Evil and Good</h3><p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</p>
<p>You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Break Enchantment</em></strong>. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dismissal</em></strong>. As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn&#39;t there already). If they aren&#39;t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.</p>
<h3>Dispel Magic</h3><p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell&#39;s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell&#39;s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.</p>
<h3>Divination</h3><p><em>4th-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god&#39;s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.</p>
<p>The spell doesn&#39;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.</p>
<p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.</p>
<h3>Divine Favor</h3><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>

<h3>Divine Word</h3><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute</li>
<li>40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes</li>
<li>30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour</li>
<li>20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn&#39;t there already) and can&#39;t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a <em>wish</em> spell.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dominate Beast</h3><p><em>4th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>
<p>While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as &quot;Attack that creature,&quot; &quot;Run over there,&quot; or &quot;Fetch that object.&quot; If the creature completes the order and doesn&#39;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>
<p>You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn&#39;t do anything that you don&#39;t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.</p>
<p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>

<h3>Dream</h3><p><em>5th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Special</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>This spell shapes a creature&#39;s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don&#39;t sleep, such as elves, can&#39;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can&#39;t take actions or move.</p>
<p>If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target&#39;s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target&#39;s dreams.</p>
<p>You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target&#39;s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>
<p>If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target&#39;s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p>
<h3>Druidcraft</h3><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:</p>

<ul>
<li>You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.</li>
<li>You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.</li>
<li>You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.</li>
<li>You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>
</ul>

<section><h1 id="Spells__E_">Spells (E)</h1><h3>Earthquake</h3><p><em>8th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 500 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</p>
<p>The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature&#39;s concentration is broken.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p>
<p>This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fissures</em></strong>. Fissures open throughout the spell&#39;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell&#39;s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure&#39;s edge as it opens.</p>
<p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p>
<p><strong><em>Structures</em></strong>. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure&#39;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn&#39;t fall prone or become buried.</p>
<h3>Eldritch Blast</h3><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.</p>
<p>The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam. </p>
<h3>Enhance Ability</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour.</p>
<p>You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bear&#39;s Endurance</em></strong>. The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bull&#39;s Strength</em></strong>. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cat&#39;s Grace</em></strong>. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn&#39;t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn&#39;t incapacitated.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eagle&#39;s Splendor</em></strong>. The target has advantage on Charisma checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fox&#39;s Cunning</em></strong>. The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Owl&#39;s Wisdom</em></strong>. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Enlarge/Reduce</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.</p>
<p>If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enlarge</em></strong>. The target&#39;s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn&#39;t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target&#39;s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target&#39;s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reduce</em></strong>. The target&#39;s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category-from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target&#39;s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target&#39;s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can&#39;t reduce the damage below 1).</p>
<h3>Entangle</h3><p><em>1st-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.</p>
<p>A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.</p>
<h3>Enthrall</h3><p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can&#39;t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.</p>
<h3>Etherealness</h3><p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Up to 8 hours</p>
<p>You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can&#39;t see anything more than 60 feet away.</p>
<p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren&#39;t on the Ethereal Plane can&#39;t perceive you and can&#39;t interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.</p>
<p>You ignore all objects and effects that aren&#39;t on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</p>
<p>This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn&#39;t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.</p>
<h3>Expeditious Retreat</h3><p><em>1st-level transmutation</em></p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>This spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take the Dash action.</p>
<h3>Eyebite</h3><p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>For the spell&#39;s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can&#39;t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of <em>eyebite</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Asleep</em></strong>. The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.</p>
<p><strong><em>Panicked</em></strong>. The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sickened</em></strong>. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__F_">Spells (F)</h1><h3>Fabricate</h3><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.</p>
<p>Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.</p>
<p>Creatures or magic items can&#39;t be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can&#39;t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan&#39;s tools used to craft such objects.</p>
<h3>Faerie Fire</h3><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>
<p>Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can&#39;t benefit from being invisible.</p>
<h3>Faithful Hound</h3><p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.</p>
<p>The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can&#39;t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.</p>
<p>At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound&#39;s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.</p>
<h3>False Life</h3><p><em>1st-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (30-foot cone)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You project a phantasmal image of a creature&#39;s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.</p>
<p>While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn&#39;t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>
<h3>Feather Fall</h3><p><em>1st-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a small feather or piece of down)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature&#39;s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.</p>
<h3>Feeblemind</h3><p><em>8th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.</p>
<p>On a failed save, the creature&#39;s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can&#39;t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.</p>
<p>At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.</p>
<p>The spell can also be ended by <em>greater restoration</em>, <em>heal</em>, or <em>wish</em>.</p>
<h3>Find Familiar</h3><p><em>1st-­level conjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>
<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can&#39;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>
<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. </p>
<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you  can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar&#39;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>
<p>As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>
<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll. </p>
<h3>Find Steed</h3><p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p>
<p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p>
<p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p>
<p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.</p>
<h3>Find the Path</h3><p><em>6th-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools- such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes-worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 day</p>
<p>This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn&#39;t specific (such as &quot;a green dragon&#39;s lair&quot;), the spell fails.</p>
<p>For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.</p>
<h3>Find Traps</h3><p><em>2nd-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the <em>alarm</em> spell, a <em>glyph of warding</em>, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.</p>
<p>This spell merely reveals that a trap is present.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.</p>
<h3>Finger of Death</h3><p><em>7th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.</p>
<h3>Fireball</h3><p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<h3>Fire Bolt</h3><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn&#39;t being worn or carried. </p>
<p>This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d10 when you  reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). </p>
<h3>Fire Shield</h3><p><em>4th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.</p>
<p>The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.</p>
<h3>Fire Storm</h3><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren&#39;t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.</p>
<h3>Flame Blade</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (leaf of sumac)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.</p>
<p>You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.</p>
<p>The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Flame Strike</h3><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
<h3>Flaming Sphere</h3><p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A 5-foot diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere&#39;s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.</p>
<p>When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Flesh to Stone</h3><p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target&#39;s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn&#39;t affected.</p>
<p>A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don&#39;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>
<p>If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.</p>
<p>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.</p>
<h3>Floating Disk</h3><p><em>1st-level conjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of mercury)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.</p>
<p>The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can&#39;t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can&#39;t move across a 10-foot deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.</p>
<p>If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can&#39;t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.</p>
<h3>Fly</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<h3>Fog Cloud</h3><p><em>1st-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Forbiddance</h3><p><em>6th-level abjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 day</p>
<p>You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can&#39;t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the <em>gate</em> spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the <em>plane shift</em> spell.</p>
<p>In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.</p>
<p>The spell&#39;s area can&#39;t overlap with the area of another <em>forbiddance</em> spell. If you cast <em>forbiddance</em> every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.</p>
<h3>Forcecage</h3><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 100 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.</p>
<p>A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.</p>
<p>A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage&#39;s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.</p>
<p>A creature inside the cage can&#39;t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can&#39;t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.</p>
<p>This spell can&#39;t be dispelled by <em>dispel magic</em>.</p>
<h3>Foresight</h3><p><em>9th-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can&#39;t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.</p>
<p>This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.</p>
<h3>Freedom of Movement</h3><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target&#39;s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target&#39;s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.</p>
<p>The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target&#39;s movement or attacks.</p>
<h3>Freezing Sphere</h3><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
<p>If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.</p>
<p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling&#39;s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn&#39;t already shattered, it explodes.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__G_">Spells (G)</h1><h3>Gaseous Form</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it&#39;s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn&#39;t affected.</p>
<p>While in this form, the target&#39;s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can&#39;t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.</p>
<p>While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can&#39;t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can&#39;t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can&#39;t attack or cast spells.</p>
<h3>Gate</h3><p><em>9th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.</p>
<p>Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn&#39;t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature&#39;s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.</p>
<h3>Geas</h3><p><em>5th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 30 days</p>
<p>You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can&#39;t understand you is unaffected by the spell.</p>
<p>You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.</p>
<p>You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A <em>remove curse</em>, <em>greater restoration</em>, or <em>wish</em> spell also ends it.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Gentle Repose</h3><p><em>2nd-level necromancy (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse&#39;s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can&#39;t become undead.</p>
<p>The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don&#39;t count against the time limit of spells such as <em>raise dead</em>.</p>
<h3>Giant Insect</h3><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.</p>
<p>Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.</p>
<p>A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.</p>
<p>The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.</p>
<h3>Glibness</h3><p><em>8th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.</p>
<h3>Globe of Invulnerability</h3><p><em>6th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (10-foot radius)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.</p>
<p>Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can&#39;t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.</p>
<h3>Glyph of Warding</h3><p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled or triggered</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>
<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>
<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>
<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don&#39;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>
<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Explosive Runes</em></strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spell Glyph</em></strong>. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an <em>explosive runes</em> glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a <em>spell glyph</em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the <em>glyph of warding</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. </p>
<p>The berries lose their potency if they have not  been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell. </p>
<h3>Grease</h3><p><em>1st-level conjuration</em></p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.</p>
<p>When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.</p>
<h3>Greater Invisibility</h3><p><em>4th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target&#39;s person.</p>
<h3>Greater Restoration</h3><p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target&#39;s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:</p>

<ul>
<li>One effect that charmed or petrified the target</li>
<li>One curse, including the target&#39;s attunement to a cursed magic item</li>
<li>Any reduction to one of the target&#39;s ability scores</li>

<h3>Guards and Wards</h3><p><em>6th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p>
<p><em>Guards and wards</em> creates the following effects within the warded area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Corridors</em></strong>. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p>
<p><strong><em>Doors</em></strong>. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <em>arcane lock</em> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <em>minor illusion</em> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stairs</em></strong>. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <em>web</em> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while <em>guards and wards</em> lasts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Spell Effect</em></strong>. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p>

<ul>
<li>Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.</li>
<li>Place magic mouth in two locations.</li>
<li>Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.</li>
<li>Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.</li>
<li>Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A <em>dispel magic</em> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.</p>
<p>You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3><p><em>Divination cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.</p>
<h3>Guiding Bolt</h3><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell&#39;s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.</p>
<p>Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.</p>
<p>The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.</p>
<p>As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__H_">Spells (H)</h1><h3>Hallow</h3><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a <em>hallow</em> spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.</p>
<p>First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can&#39;t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.</p>
<p>Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Courage</em></strong>. Affected creatures can&#39;t be frightened while in the area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkness</em></strong>. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can&#39;t illuminate the area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Daylight</em></strong>. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can&#39;t extinguish the light.</p>
<p><strong><em>Energy Protection</em></strong>. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Energy Vulnerability</em></strong>. Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Everlasting Rest</em></strong>. Dead bodies interred in the area can&#39;t be turned into undead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Extradimensional Interference</em></strong>. Affected creatures can&#39;t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fear</em></strong>. Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silence</em></strong>. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tongues</em></strong>. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don&#39;t share a common language.</p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren&#39;t changed in appearance.</p>
<p>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn&#39;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.</p>
<h3>Harm</h3><p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can&#39;t reduce the target&#39;s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature&#39;s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.</p>
<h3>Haste</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>

That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the target can&#39;t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.</p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.</p>
<p>If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn&#39;t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

<p>A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage.

A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn&#39;t affected.</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>Hailstones turn the storm&#39;s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
<h3>Identify</h3><p><em>1st-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.</p>
<p>If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.</p>
<h3>Illusory Script</h3><p><em>1st-level illusion (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.</p>
<p>Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.</p>
<p>A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.</p>
<h3>Imprisonment</h3><p><em>9th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn&#39;t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn&#39;t age. Divination spells can&#39;t locate or perceive the target.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burial</em></strong>. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.</p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chaining</em></strong>. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can&#39;t move or be moved by any means until then.</p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hedged Prison</em></strong>. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.</p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimus Containment</em></strong>. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can&#39;t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.</p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slumber</em></strong>. The target falls asleep and can&#39;t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ending the Spell</em></strong>. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature&#39;s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.</p>
<p>A <em>dispel magic</em> spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p>
<p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.</p>
<h3>Incendiary Cloud</h3><p><em>8th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p>
<p>When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>
<p>The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Insect Plague</h3><p><em>5th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere&#39;s area is difficult terrain.</p>
<p>When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
<h3>Instant Summons</h3><p><em>6th-level conjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.</p>
<p>At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item&#39;s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.</p>
<p>If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn&#39;t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.</p>
<p><em>Dispel magic</em> or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell&#39;s effect.</p>
<h3>Invisibility</h3><p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target&#39;s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Irresistible Dance</h3><p><em>6th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can&#39;t be charmed are immune to this spell.</p>
<p>A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.</p>

<p>A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.</p>
<p>If you choose a target that is held shut with <em>arcane lock</em>, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.</p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn&#39;t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.</p>
<p>The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: &quot;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word <em>Rudnogg</em> on the lips.&quot;</p>
<h3>Lesser Restoration</h3><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.</p>
<p>The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target&#39;s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell&#39;s range.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.</p>
<h3>Light</h3><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p>

The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.</p>
<p>If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p>
<h3>Lightning Bolt</h3><p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

<p>The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close-within 30 feet-at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a <em>polymorph</em> spell, this spell doesn&#39;t locate the creature.</p>
<p>This spell can&#39;t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.</p>

<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature who isn&#39;t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target&#39;s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.</p>
<h3>Mage Hand</h3><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p>

<h3>Magic Circle</h3><p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em></p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a 10-foot radius, 20-foot tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.</p>
<p>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The creature can&#39;t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.</li>
<li>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.</li>
<li>Targets within the cylinder can&#39;t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<h3>Magic Jar</h3><p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell&#39;s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container&#39;s space. You can&#39;t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.</p>
<p>You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a <em>protection from evil and good</em> or <em>magic circle</em> spell can&#39;t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target&#39;s body, and the target&#39;s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can&#39;t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Once you possess a creature&#39;s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can&#39;t use any of its class features.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the possessed creature&#39;s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can&#39;t move or take actions at all.</p>
<p>While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature&#39;s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you&#39;re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.</p>
<p>If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature&#39;s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature&#39;s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.</p>
<h3>Magic Missile</h3><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.</p>

<h3>Magic Mouth</h3><p><em>2nd-level illusion (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn&#39;t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.</p>
<p>When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object&#39;s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.</p>
<p>The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.</p>
<h3>Magic Weapon</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>

<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.</p>
<p>Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p>
<p>You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can&#39;t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can&#39;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can&#39;t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p>
<h3>Major Image</h3><p><em>3rd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of fleece)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can&#39;t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte&#39;s stench).</p>
<p>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>
<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.</p>
<h3>Mass Cure Wounds</h3><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
<h3>Mass Heal</h3><p><em>9th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<h3>Mass Healing Word</h3><p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<h3>Mass Suggestion</h3><p><em>6th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a snake&#39;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can&#39;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.</p>
<p>Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>
<p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn&#39;t met before the spell ends, the activity isn&#39;t performed.</p>
<p>If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.</p>
<h3>Maze</h3><p><em>8th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.</p>
<p>The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
<h3>Meld into Stone</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.</p>
<p>While merged with the stone, you can&#39;t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can&#39;t move.</p>
<p>Minor physical damage to the stone doesn&#39;t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone&#39;s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.</p>
<h3>Mending</h3><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (two lodestones)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.</p>
<p>This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can&#39;t restore magic to such an object.</p>
<h3>Message</h3><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.</p>
<p>You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn&#39;t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>
<h3>Meteor Swarm</h3><p><em>9th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 1 mile</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.</p>
<p>The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Mind Blank</h3><p><em>8th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition. The spell even foils <em>wish</em> spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target&#39;s mind or to gain information about the target.</p>
<h3>Minor Illusion</h3><p><em>Illusion cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> S, M (a bit of fleece)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.</p>
<p>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&#39;s voice, a lion&#39;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p>
<p>If you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&#39;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p>
<p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>
<h3>Mirage Arcane</h3><p><em>7th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Sight</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain&#39;s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn&#39;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.</p>
<p>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell&#39;s area disappears immediately.</p>
<p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain&#39;s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion&#39;s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.</p>
<h3>Mirror Image</h3><p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it&#39;s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.</p>
<p>Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell&#39;s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.</p>
<p>If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack&#39;s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.</p>
<p>A duplicate&#39;s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.</p>
<p>A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can&#39;t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.</p>
<h3>Mislead</h3><p><em>5th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.</p>
<p>You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.</p>
<p>You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.</p>
<h3>Misty Step</h3><p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.</p>
<h3>Modify Memory</h3><p><em>5th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to reshape another creature&#39;s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target&#39;s memories are modified.</p>
<p>While this charm lasts, you can affect the target&#39;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p>
<p>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature&#39;s memory isn&#39;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p>
<p>A modified memory doesn&#39;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature&#39;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p>
<p>A <em>remove curse</em> or <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the target restores the creature&#39;s true memory.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target&#39;s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature&#39;s past (9th level).</p>
<h3>Moonbeam</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p>
<p>When a creature enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can&#39;t assume a different form until it leaves the spell&#39;s light.</p>
<p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Move Earth</h3><p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils-clay, loam, and sand)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 2 hours</p>
<p>Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area&#39;s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can&#39;t exceed half the area&#39;s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square&#39;s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.</p>
<p>At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.</p>
<p>Because the terrain&#39;s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can&#39;t usually be trapped or injured by the ground&#39;s movement.</p>
<p>This spell can&#39;t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.</p>
<p>Similarly, this spell doesn&#39;t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__N_">Spells (N)</h1><h3>Nondetection</h3><p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can&#39;t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can&#39;t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.</p>
<h3>Passwall</h3><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening&#39;s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.</p>
<p>When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.</p>
<h3>Phantasmal Killer</h3><p><em>4th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target&#39;s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
<h3>Phantom Steed</h3><p><em>3rd-level illusion (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature&#39;s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.</p>
<p>For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.</p>
<h3>Planar Ally</h3><p><em>6th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature&#39;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM&#39;s choice).</p>
<p>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn&#39;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p>
<p>Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature&#39;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p>
<p>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature&#39;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p>
<p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p>
<h3>Planar Binding</h3><p><em>5th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted <em>magic circle</em> in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell&#39;s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.</p>
<p>A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.</p>
<h3>Plane Shift</h3><p><em>7th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM&#39;s discretion.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.</p>
<p>You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.</p>
<h3>Plant Growth</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action or 8 hours</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.</p>
<p>If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.</p>
<p>You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell&#39;s area from being affected.</p>
<p>If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.</p>
<h3>Poison Spray</h3><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage. </p>
<p>This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d12 when you  reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12). </p>
<h3>Polymorph</h3><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.</p>
<p>The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target&#39;s (or the target&#39;s level, if it doesn&#39;t have a challenge rating). The target&#39;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.</p>
<p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce the creature&#39;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#39;t knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#39;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.</p>
<p>The target&#39;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can&#39;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
<h3>Power Word Kill</h3><p><em>9th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.</p>
<h3>Power Word Stun</h3><p><em>8th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.</p>
<p>The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.</p>
<h3>Prayer of Healing</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Prestidigitation</h3><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Up to 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within Range:</p>

<ul>
<li>You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.</li>
<li>You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>
<li>You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</li>
<li>You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.</li>
<li>You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.</li>
<li>You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>
<h3>Prismatic Spray</h3><p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (60-foot cone)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Red</em></strong>. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong><em>Orange</em></strong>. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong><em>Yellow</em></strong>. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong><em>Green</em></strong>. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong><em>Blue</em></strong>. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong><em>Indigo</em></strong>. On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don&#39;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</li>
<li><strong><em>Violet</em></strong>. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM&#39;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn&#39;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Special</em></strong>. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prismatic Wall</h3><p><em>9th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>The spell no longer refers to a rod of cancellation, and the text clarifies that dispel magic works only against the violet layer.</p>
<p>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.</p>
<p>The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.</p>
<p>The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall&#39;s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer&#39;s properties as described below.</p>
<p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An <em>antimagic field</em> has no effect on it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Red</em></strong>. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can&#39;t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</li>
<li><strong><em>Orange</em></strong>. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can&#39;t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</li>
<li><strong><em>Yellow</em></strong>. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</li>
<li><strong><em>Green</em></strong>. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A <em>passwall</em> spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</li>
<li><strong><em>Blue</em></strong>. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</li>
<li><strong><em>Indigo</em></strong>. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don&#39;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can&#39;t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a <em>daylight</em> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</li>
<li><strong><em>Violet</em></strong>. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM&#39;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn&#39;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a <em>dispel magic</em> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Private Sanctum</h3><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sound can&#39;t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.</li>
<li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.</li>
<li>Sensors created by divination spells can&#39;t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.</li>
<li>Creatures in the area can&#39;t be targeted by divination spells.</li>
<li>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>
<li>Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.</p>
<h3>Produce Flame</h3><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.</p>
<p>You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.</p>
<p>This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
<h3>Programmed Illusion</h3><p><em>6th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.</p>
<p>The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.</p>
<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>
<h3>Project Image</h3><p><em>7th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 500 miles</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 day</p>
<p>You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.</p>
<p>You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.</p>
<p>You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.</p>
<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A</p>
<p>creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>
<h3>Protection from Energy</h3><p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.</p>
<h3>Protection from Evil and Good</h3><p><em>1st-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.</p>
<p>The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can&#39;t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.</p>
<h3>Protection from Poison</h3><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.</p>
<p>For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.</p>
<h3>Purify Food and Drink</h3><p><em>1st-level transmutation (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>All nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__Q_">Spells (Q)</h1>
</section>
<section><h1 id="Spells__R_">Spells (R)</h1><h3>Raise Dead</h3><p><em>5th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature&#39;s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.</p>
<p>This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn&#39;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren&#39;t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can&#39;t return an undead creature to life.</p>
<p>This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn&#39;t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails.</p>
<p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p>
<h3>Ray of Enfeeblement</h3><p><em>2nd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.</p>
<p>At the end of each of the target&#39;s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.</p>
<h3>Ray of Frost</h3><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>The spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
<h3>Regenerate</h3><p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).</p>
<p>The target&#39;s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.</p>
<h3>Reincarnate</h3><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.</p>
<p>If the target&#39;s soul isn&#39;t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.</p>
<p>The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature&#39;s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.</p>

<h3>Remove Curse</h3><p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner&#39;s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.</p>
<h3>Resilient Sphere</h3><p><em>4th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.</p>
<p>Nothing-not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects-can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can&#39;t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.</p>
<p>The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere&#39;s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature&#39;s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.</p>
<p>A <em>disintegrate</em> spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.</p>
<h3>Resistance</h3><p><em>Abjuration cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a miniature cloak)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.</p>
<h3>Resurrection</h3><p><em>7th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn&#39;t die of old age, and that isn&#39;t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.</p>
<p>This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn&#39;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren&#39;t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.</p>
<p>This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.</p>
<p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p>
<p>Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can&#39;t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
<h3>Reverse Gravity</h3><p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 100 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren&#39;t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.</p>
<p>If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p>
<p>At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.</p>
<h3>Revivify</h3><p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can&#39;t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.</p>
<h3>Rope Trick</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.</p>
<p>The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.</p>
<p>Attacks and spells can&#39;t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.</p>
<p>Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__S_">Spells (S)</h1><h3>Sacred Flame</h3><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.</p>
<p>The spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
<h3>Sanctuary</h3><p><em>1st-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small silver mirror)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn&#39;t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.</p>
<p>If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.</p>
<h3>Scorching Ray</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.</p>
<p>Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Scrying</h3><p><em>5th-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you&#39;re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.</p>

<p>On a successful save, the target isn&#39;t affected, and you can&#39;t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.</p>
<p>On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.</p>
<p>Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn&#39;t move.</p>
<h3>Secret Chest</h3><p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).</p>
<p>While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.</p>
<p>After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell&#39;s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.</p>
<h3>See Invisibility</h3><p><em>2nd-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.</p>
<h3>Seeming</h3><p><em>5th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.</p>
<p>The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&#39;t change a target&#39;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature&#39;s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature&#39;s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p>
<p>A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.</p>
<h3>Sending</h3><p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Unlimited</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.</p>
<p>You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn&#39;t arrive.</p>
<h3>Sequester</h3><p><em>7th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can&#39;t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.</p>
<p>If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn&#39;t grow older.</p>
<p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include &quot;after 1,000 years&quot; or &quot;when the tarrasque awakens.&quot; This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.</p>
<h3>Shapechange</h3><p><em>9th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can&#39;t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.</p>
<p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature&#39;s bonus in place of yours. You can&#39;t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.</p>
<p>You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&#39;t knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can&#39;t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.</p>
<p>When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&#39;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&#39;t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&#39;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.</p>
<p>During this spell&#39;s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.</p>
<h3>Shatter</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a chip of mica)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
<p>A nonmagical object that isn&#39;t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it&#39;s in the spell&#39;s area.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Shield</h3><p><em>1st-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the <em>magic missile</em> spell</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from <em>magic missile</em>.</p>
<h3>Shield of Faith</h3><p><em>1st-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.</p>
<h3>Shillelagh</h3><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature&#39;s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon&#39;s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn&#39;t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.</p>
<h3>Shocking Grasp</h3><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can&#39;t take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p>The spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
<h3>Silence</h3><p><em>2nd-level illusion (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</p>
<h3>Silent Image</h3><p><em>1st-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of fleece)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn&#39;t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.</p>
<p>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.</p>
<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.</p>
<h3>Simulacrum</h3><p><em>7th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 12 hours</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature&#39;s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature&#39;s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.</p>
<p>The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.</p>
<p>If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.</p>
<p>If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.</p>
<h3>Sleep</h3><p><em>1st-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).</p>
<p>Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature&#39;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature&#39;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p>
<p>Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren&#39;t affected by this spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Sleet Storm</h3><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.</p>
<p>The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.</p>
<p>If a creature starts its turn in the spell&#39;s area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.</p>
<h3>Slow</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of molasses)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p>
<p>An affected target&#39;s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can&#39;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature&#39;s abilities or magic items, it can&#39;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>
<p>If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn&#39;t take effect until the creature&#39;s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can&#39;t, the spell is wasted.</p>
<p>A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p>
<h3>Spare the Dying</h3><p><em>Necromancy cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<h3>Speak with Animals</h3><p><em>1st-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM&#39;s discretion.</p>
<h3>Speak with Dead</h3><p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (burning incense)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can&#39;t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn&#39;t return the creature&#39;s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can&#39;t learn new information, doesn&#39;t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can&#39;t speculate about future events.</p>
<h3>Speak with Plants</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (30-foot radius)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell&#39;s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.</p>
<p>You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.</p>
<p>Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM&#39;s discretion. The spell doesn&#39;t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.</p>
<p>If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.</p>
<p>This spell can cause the plants created by the <em>entangle</em> spell to release a restrained creature.</p>
<h3>Spider Climb</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.</p>
<h3>Spike Growth</h3><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.</p>
<p>The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can&#39;t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.</p>
<h3>Spirit Guardians</h3><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot radius)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a holy symbol)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature&#39;s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<h3>Spiritual Weapon</h3><p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
<p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell&#39;s effect resemble that weapon.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p>
<h3>Stinking Cloud</h3><p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a 20-foot radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.</p>
<p>Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don&#39;t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>
<p>A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p>
<h3>Stone Shape</h3><p><em>4th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn&#39;t possible.</p>
<h3>Stoneskin</h3><p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>
<h3>Storm of Vengeance</h3><p><em>9th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Sight</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces different effects on your turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Round 2</em></strong>. Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Round 3</em></strong>. You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can&#39;t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Round 4</em></strong>. Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Round 5-10</em></strong>. Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3><p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a snake&#39;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 8 hours</p>
<p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can&#39;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.</p>
<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>
<p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn&#39;t met before the spell expires, the activity isn&#39;t performed.</p>
<p>If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p>
<h3>Sunbeam</h3><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (60-foot line)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a magnifying glass)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot wide, 60-foot long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
<p>You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.</p>
<p>For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.</p>
<h3>Sunburst</h3><p><em>8th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
<p>A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.</p>
<p>This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.</p>
<h3>Symbol</h3><p><em>7th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled or triggered</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>
<p>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.</p>
<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p>
<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature&#39;s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don&#39;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>
<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Death</em></strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Discord</em></strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fear</em></strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hopelessness</em></strong>. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can&#39;t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insanity</em></strong>. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can&#39;t take actions, can&#39;t understand what other creatures say, can&#39;t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pain</em></strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sleep</em></strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stunning</em></strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__T_">Spells (T)</h1><h3>Telekinesis</h3><p><em>5th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creature</em></strong>. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature&#39;s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.</p>
<p>On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Object</em></strong>. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn&#39;t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.</p>
<p>If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature&#39;s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.</p>
<p>You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.</p>
<h3>Telepathic Bond</h3><p><em>5th-level divination (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren&#39;t affected by this spell.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can&#39;t extend to other planes of existence.</p>
<h3>Teleport</h3><p><em>7th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can&#39;t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.</p>
<p>The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong><em>Familiarity</em></strong>. &quot;Permanent circle&quot; means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. &quot;Associated object&quot; means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard&#39;s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich&#39;s secret tomb.</p>
<p>&quot;Very familiar&quot; is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. &quot;Seen casually&quot; is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren&#39;t very familiar. &quot;Viewed once&quot; is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. &quot;Description&quot; is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else&#39;s description, perhaps from a map.</p>
<p>&quot;False destination&quot; is a place that doesn&#39;t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy&#39;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>
<p><strong><em>On Target</em></strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>
<p><strong><em>Off Target</em></strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>
<p><strong><em>Similar Area</em></strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that&#39;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard&#39;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mishap</em></strong>. The spell&#39;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>
<h3>Teleportation Circle</h3><p><em>5th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>
<p>Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.</p>
<p>You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.</p>
<h3>Thaumaturgy</h3><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within Range:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.</li>
<li>You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.</li>
<li>You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.</li>
<li>You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.</li>
<li>You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.</li>
<li>You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thunderwave</h3><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot cube)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t pushed.</p>
<p>In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&#39;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<h3>Time Stop</h3><p><em>9th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.</p>
<p>This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.</p>
<h3>Tiny Hut</h3><p><em>3rd-level evocation (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (10-foot radius hemisphere)</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small crystal bead)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>A 10-foot radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.</p>
<p>Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can&#39;t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.</p>
<h3>Tongues</h3><p><em>3rd-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.</p>
<h3>Transport via Plants</h3><p><em>6th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.</p>
<h3>Tree Stride</h3><p><em>5th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you&#39;re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.</p>
<p>You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.</p>
<h3>True Polymorph</h3><p><em>9th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.</p>
<p>This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn&#39;t affected by this spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creature into Creature</em></strong>. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target&#39;s (or its level, if the target doesn&#39;t have a challenge rating). The target&#39;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.</p>
<p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce the creature&#39;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#39;t knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#39;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.</p>
<p>The target&#39;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can&#39;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Object into Creature</em></strong>. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature&#39;s size is no larger than the object&#39;s size and the creature&#39;s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature&#39;s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.</p>
<p>If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creature into Object</em></strong>. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object&#39;s size is no larger than the creature&#39;s size. The creature&#39;s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.</p>
<h3>True Resurrection</h3><p><em>9th-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature&#39;s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.</p>
<p>This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.</p>
<p>The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature&#39;s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.</p>
<h3>True Seeing</h3><p><em>6th-level divination</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
<h3>True Strike</h3><p><em>Divination cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 round</p>
<p>You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target&#39;s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn&#39;t ended.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Spells__U_">Spells (U)</h1><h3>Unseen Servant</h3><p><em>1st-level conjuration (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can&#39;t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.</p>
<p>Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.</p>
<p>If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Spells__V_">Spells (V)</h1><h3>Vampiric Touch</h3><p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<h3>Vicious Mockery</h3><p><em>Enchantment cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>
<p>This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

<section><h1 id="Spells__W_">Spells (W)</h1><h3>Wall of Fire</h3><p><em>4th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
<p>One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
<h3>Wall of Force</h3><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature&#39;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).</p>
<p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can&#39;t be dispelled by <em>dispel magic</em>. A <em>disintegrate</em> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>
<h3>Wall of Ice</h3><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>If the wall cuts through a creature&#39;s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
<p>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.</p>
<h3>Wall of Stone</h3><p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small block of granite)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</p>
<p>If the wall cuts through a creature&#39;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>
<p>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&#39;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn&#39;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p>
<p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</p>
<p>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM&#39;s discretion.</p>
<p>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&#39;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</p>
<h3>Wall of Thorns</h3><p><em>6th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a handful of thorns)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.</p>
<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
<p>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
<h3>Warding Bond</h3><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.</p>
<p>The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.</p>
<h3>Water Breathing</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.</p>
<h3>Water Walk</h3><p><em>3rd-level transmutation (ritual)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of cork)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.</p>
<p>If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.</p>
<h3>Web</h3><p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.</p>
<p>If the webs aren&#39;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.</p>
<p>Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a</p>
<p>Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.</p>
<p>A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.</p>
<p>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>
<h3>Weird</h3><p><em>9th-level illusion</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to one minute</p>
<p>Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature&#39;s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature&#39;s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>
<h3>Wind Walk</h3><p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (fire and holy water)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can&#39;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.</p>
<p>If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can&#39;t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.</p>
<h3>Wind Wall</h3><p><em>3rd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can&#39;t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can&#39;t pass through it.</p>
<h3>Wish</h3><p><em>9th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>
<p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don&#39;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>

<ul>
<li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn&#39;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>
<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the <em>greater restoration</em> spell.</li>
<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>
<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich&#39;s life drain attack.</li>
<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>wish</em> spell could undo an opponent&#39;s successful save, a foe&#39;s critical hit, or a friend&#39;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item&#39;s current owner.</p>
<p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can&#39;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn&#39;t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <em>wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>
<h3>Word of Recall</h3><p><em>6th-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 5 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.</p>
<p>You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn&#39;t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.</p>

<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can&#39;t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.</p>
<p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>

<section><h1 id="Monster_Statistics">Monster Statistics</h1><h2>Type</h2><p>A monster&#39;s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an <em>arrow of dragon slaying</em> deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.</p>
<p>The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature&#39;s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.</p>
<p><strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.</p>
<p><strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.</p>
<p><strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.</p>
<p><strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.</p>
<p><strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</p>
<p><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.</p>
<p><strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.</p>
<p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>
<p><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don&#39;t fit into any other type.</p>
<p><strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.</p>
<p><strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.</p>
<p><strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.</p>
<h3>Tags</h3><p>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the <em>humanoid (orc)</em> type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.</p>
<h2>Alignment</h2><p>A monster&#39;s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em> for descriptions of the different alignments.</p>
<p>The alignment specified in a monster&#39;s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster&#39;s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there&#39;s nothing stopping you.</p>
<p>Some creatures can have <strong>any alignment</strong>. In other words, you choose the monster&#39;s alignment. Some monster&#39;s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.</p>
<p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don&#39;t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are <strong>unaligned</strong>, which means they don&#39;t have an alignment.</p>
<h2>Armor Class</h2><p>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster&#39;s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.</p>
<h2>Hit Points</h2><p>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.</p>
<p>A monster&#39;s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).</p>
<p>A monster&#39;s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p>
<p><strong>Table- Hit Dice by Size</strong></p>

<p>A monster&#39;s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8+2 hit points (average 11).</p>
<h2>Speed</h2><p>A monster&#39;s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.</p>
<p>All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster&#39;s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.</p>
<p>Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.</p>
<h3>Burrow</h3><p>A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can&#39;t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.</p>
<h3>Climb</h3><p>A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn&#39;t need to spend extra movement to climb.</p>
<h3>Fly</h3><p>A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to <strong>hover</strong>, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.</p>
<h3>Swim</h3><p>A monster that has a swimming speed doesn&#39;t need to spend extra movement to swim.</p>
<h2>Ability Scores</h2><p>Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they&#39;re used in play, see the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.</p>
<h2>Saving Throws</h2><p>The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn&#39;t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don&#39;t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.</p>
<p>A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster&#39;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster&#39;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).</p>

<h2>Skills</h2><p>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
<p>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster&#39;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster&#39;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.</em></p>
<p><em>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.</em></p>
<p><em>See the Player&#39;s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.</em></p>
<h2>Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities</h2><p>Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.</p>
<h2>Senses</h2><p>The Senses entry notes a monster&#39;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.</p>
<h3>Blindsight</h3><p>A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.</p>
<p>Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.</p>
<p>If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.</p>
<h3>Darkvision</h3><p>A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can&#39;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.</p>
<h3>Tremorsense</h3><p>A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can&#39;t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.</p>
<h3>Truesight</h3><p>A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2><p>The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can&#39;t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A &quot;-&quot; indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.</p>
<h3>Telepathy</h3><p>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn&#39;t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can&#39;t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.</p>
<p>A telepathic monster doesn&#39;t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can&#39;t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.</p>
<p>A creature within the area of an <em>antimagic field</em> or in any other location where magic doesn&#39;t function can&#39;t send or receive telepathic messages.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2><p>A monster&#39;s <strong>Challenge rating</strong> tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.</p>
<p>Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.</p>
<p>Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3><p>The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.</p>
<p>Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.</p>

<h2>Special Traits</h2><p>Special traits (which appear after a monster&#39;s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.</p>
<h3>Innate Spellcasting</h3><p>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can&#39;t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster&#39;s challenge rating.</p>
<p>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the <em>levitate</em> spell, but the spell has a &quot;self only&quot; restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.</p>
<p>A monster&#39;s innate spells can&#39;t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster&#39;s innate spells don&#39;t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.</p>
<h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.</p>
<p>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.</p>
<p>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level <em>lightning bolt</em> spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.</p>
<h3>Psionics</h3><p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn&#39;t require any components to cast its spells.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2><p>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.</p>
<h3>Melee and Ranged Attacks</h3><p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the &quot;weapon&quot; might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creature vs Target</em></strong>. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a &quot;target&quot; can be a creature or an object.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hit</em></strong>. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the &quot;Hit&quot; notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.</p>
<p><strong><em>Miss</em></strong>. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the &quot;Miss:&quot; notation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grapple Rules for Monsters</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn&#39;t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.</em></p>
<p><em>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster&#39;s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10+the monster&#39;s Strength (Athletics) modifier.</em></p>
<h3>Multiattack</h3><p>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can&#39;t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.</p>
<h3>Ammunition</h3><p>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.</p>
<h2>Reactions</h2><p>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.</p>
<h2>Limited Usage</h2><p>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.</p>
<p><strong><em>X/Day</em></strong>. The notation &quot;X/Day&quot; means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, &quot;1/Day&quot; means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recharge X-Y</em></strong>. The notation &quot;Recharge X-Y&quot; means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster&#39;s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;Recharge 5-6&quot; means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster&#39;s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest</em></strong>. This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2><p>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.</p>
<p>You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster&#39;s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.</p>
<p>If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.</p>

</section>
<section><h1 id="Legendary_Creatures">Legendary Creatures</h1><p>A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can&#39;t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.</p>
<p>If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn&#39;t gain that form&#39;s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.</p>
<h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&#39;s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can&#39;t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can&#39;t use them until after its first turn in the combat.</p>
<h2>A Legendary Creature&#39;s Lair</h2><p>A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.</p>
<h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can&#39;t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can&#39;t use one until after its first turn in the combat.</p>
<h3>Regional Effects</h3><p>The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.</p>

<p><strong>Petrifying Gaze</strong>. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn&#39;t incapacitated.

A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.</p>
<p>If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir.

If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target&#39;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a <em>greater restoration</em> spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.</p>
<p><strong><em>Possession (Recharge 6)</em></strong>. One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn&#39;t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can&#39;t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target&#39;s statistics, but doesn&#39;t gain access to the target&#39;s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</p>
<p>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the <em>dispel evil and good</em> spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</p>

While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken&#39;s turns.</p>
<p>If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tentacle</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (3d6+10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18).

If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Storm</em></strong>. The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it.

<p><strong><em>Petrifying Gaze</em></strong>. When a creature that can see the medusa&#39;s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn&#39;t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the <em>greater restoration</em> spell or other magic.</p>
<p>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can&#39;t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p>
<p>If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.</p>

<p><strong><em>Reflective Carapace</em></strong>. Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a <em>magic missile</em> spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Siege Monster</em></strong>. The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3><p><strong><em>Multiattack</em></strong>. The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 36 (4d12+10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can&#39;t bite another target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d8+10) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horns</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 32 (4d10+10) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 24 (4d6+10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence</em></strong>. Each creature of the tarrasque&#39;s choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature&#39;s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque&#39;s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swallow</em></strong>. The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite&#39;s damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque&#39;s turns.</p>
<p>If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3><p>The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&#39;s turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Attack</strong>. The tarrasque makes one claw attack or tail attack.</p>
<p><strong>Move</strong>. The tarrasque moves up to half its speed.</p>
<p><strong>Chomp (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>. The tarrasque makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 13 (10,000 XP)</p>
<p><strong><em>Shapechanger</em></strong>. If the vampire isn&#39;t in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</p>
<p>While in bat form, the vampire can&#39;t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
<p>While in mist form, the vampire can&#39;t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&#39;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&#39;t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</em></strong>. If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Escape</em></strong>. When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn&#39;t in sunlight or running water. If it can&#39;t transform, it is destroyed.</p>
<p>While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can&#39;t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration</em></strong>. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn&#39;t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn&#39;t function at the start of the vampire&#39;s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb</em></strong>. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vampire Weaknesses</em></strong>. The vampire has the following flaws:</p>
<p><em>Forbiddance</em>. The vampire can&#39;t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</p>
<p><em>Harmed by Running Water</em>. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.</p>
<p><em>Stake to the Heart</em>. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire&#39;s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</p>
<p><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity</em>. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3><p><strong><em>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)</em></strong>. The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target&#39;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire&#39;s control.</p>
<p><strong><em>Charm</em></strong>. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn&#39;t under the vampire&#39;s control, it takes the vampire&#39;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&#39;s bite attack.</p>
<p>Each time the vampire or the vampire&#39;s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Children of the Night (1/Day)</em></strong>. The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn&#39;t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3><p>The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&#39;s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Move</strong>. The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
